# HW4 - Mouse Interaction

## Description
  This is a top-down shooter where you (the green square in the center) must defend yourself from endless waves of enemies using the infinite amounts of ammo at your disposal. Enemies will randomly drop yellow medallions (also just squares) that you can drag back to your turret to progress to the next level, but beware, the enemies level up right along with you! Your turret has limited defenses, so if even one enemy reaches you, it's Game Over! How long will you survive?

## Controls
  __Left-click__ (hold or tap) - shoot
  
  __Right-click__ (click and drag) - move medallions

# MenuSceneTextProject
Assignment due 11/11/19 For CPSC 3520 UTC Fall '19

## Instructions
Use arrow keys and enter to navigate menus, point and left-click to shoot enemies. Pick up collectibles that enemies drop by right-clicking and dragging them onto your turret.
You must collect one collectible per player level (i.e. 2 collectibles at level 2) to advance to the next level. After you beat level 5 you win the game.

## Notes
1. I am sorry this isn't as clean as it could be. If I had more time (or less other stuff going on) the code would be much cleaner and more reader-friendly.
2. We didn't put in sounds for each mouse click (because it would be constant noise), so instead we added sounds for level-up and enemy deaths.
3. This does use a modified version of game_package, but I've discussed both with you previously. The changes are the more accessible SimpleMenu (pull request made today) and the addition of the setString method to the Text class.

Thanks,
Riley
